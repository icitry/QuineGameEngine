# QuineGameEngine

Join me as I create a Quine Game Engine, which allows you to develop games as you would do it normally, except using APIs developed by yours truly, and compiling them using a custom tool that converts your beautiful creations into their most condensed form, to be enjoyed by everyone.

By making use of different techniques and technologies, like the C Language, JavaScript, Rollup.js, Terser, various optimization I attempt to recreate PacMan (the game) in its entirety and have it run as a Quine on its own source code.
